# initial workforce wf0 age of entry x age current at time t  [ae x at -- rows, columns] -- upper triangular, ae <= at
# k x k, where k=az - a0 + 1
# the cells are the number of employees who entered at a given age, and their current age
# the diagonal represents entry age distribution of new hires

a0 <- 20 # youngest age of entry
az <- 25 # last possible year of working
k <- az - a0 + 1 # number of rows and columns in the wf matrix (number of years); one version of the paper forgot to add 1

# make up some data for number of employees - each cell gives number of workers by age at entry (rows) and age current (columns)
# a worker's current age can't be less than age at entry so the lower left triangle is empty
# start by creating the workers upper triangle (represented as a vector)

# the trick here: we want to fill the upper triangle of the  matrix by row, while matrix is filled 
  # by colomn by defaut. So we first fill the lower triangle by column and transpose it to get the 
  # the upper triangle matrix filled by row.

# simplification: give everyone the same separation rate at a given attained age regardless of age of entry
