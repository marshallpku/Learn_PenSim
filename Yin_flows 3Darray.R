## Inputs and Initialization ####
 # Currently only initial workforce is defined in this section. 
 # Need a complete list of initial inputs:
   # Initial workforce
   # Decrement table
   # vesting policy
   # growth of workforce(controlled by growth rate or pre-defined path of growth.)


## setting range of age/entry age, and number of years to be simulated.
range_ea  <- seq(20, 60, 5) # For now, assume new entrants only enter the workforce with interval of 5 years. 
range_age <- 20:110 
nyears    <- 100 
 # Age and entry age make a total of 91 * 9 = 819 cells. 

## A 3D array is created for each of the 6 status:
#  (1)Active
#  (2)Terminated, vested
#  (3)Terminated, non-vested
#  (4)Disabled
#  (5)Retired
#  (6)Dead
 
 # Retired can be further divided into 3 types by source this feature will be add in future versions
  #  (5)-1 Retired from active 
  #  (5)-2 Retired from teriminated, vested
  #  (5)-3 Retired from disabled

## In each 3D array, dimension 1(row) represents entry age, dimension 2(column) represents attained age,
   # dimension 3(depth) represents number of year. 
wf_dim <- c(length(range_ea), length(range_age), nyears)
wf_dimnames <- list(range_ea, range_age, 1:nyears)

wf_active  <- array(0, wf_dim, dimnames = wf_dimnames)
wf_term_v  <- array(0, wf_dim, dimnames = wf_dimnames)
wf_term_nv <- array(0, wf_dim, dimnames = wf_dimnames)
wf_disb    <- array(0, wf_dim, dimnames = wf_dimnames)
wf_retired <- array(0, wf_dim, dimnames = wf_dimnames)
wf_dead    <- array(0, wf_dim, dimnames = wf_dimnames)

# In each iteration we work with a slice of the array wf_XXX[, , i], which is a matrix
class(wf_active[, , 1])
dim(wf_active[, , 1]) # 9 entry ages and 91 ages, 819 cells

# idea: we can even combine the 6 arrays above into a 4D array, where the 4th dimension represents the status. 
  # While this may make the the code slightly less straitforward, it can make the code neater and the summarization 
  # easier.
  # eg. extract the active: wf[, , , "active"]
  # eg. get the total population over time: apply(wf, 3, sum)

# Initialize workforce 
# case 1: Initial workforece only have workers at eath entry age
wf_active[, as.character(range_ea), 1] <- diag(seq(1000, by  = -100, length = 9))

## Transition matrices ####

# The transition process between status are illustrated in 
  # https://www.lucidchart.com/documents/edit/8b99d535-261b-4982-9723-5cbae5f5e86e

# Importing decrement rates

# Notes
# 1. We need to think carefully how to define the retirment process. Here I will define it indirectly, that is, 
# all those who do not become ineligible to retirement(term-nonvested)/impossible to retire(dead) will retire
# when they turn 65. Doing this will ensure all active workers who become disabled or terminated-vested during 
# age 64 will enter the status Retired when they turn 65, rather than entering the pool of disabled or terminated-vested
# when they turn 65. Without doing so (see the the excel file Winkelvoss(13).xlsx sheet flow(2)) will cause 
# the status terminated-vested and disabled still have positive number of members in them after age 65, while 
# all of them are supposed to retire at age 65. 

# 2. When the only purpose is simulating workforce flow, we do not ditinguish between active-turned retirement,
# disabled-turned retirement and vested-turned retirement. But when we want to caluculate retirement 
# benefits, I need to distinguish between them because they will have different benefits. (active-turned and 
# disabled/vested-turned retiree receive different amount of annuity even thay have the same age and entry age.) 

# 3. Feature to be added: More realistic rule for determining whether a terminated worker will become vested
# or non-vested. eg. 5 yos to become vested.
