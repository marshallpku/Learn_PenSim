# Benefit table by 3Darray

## Notes:
 # This program calculates accrued benefits, benefits accrual and various actuarial liability measures based on 
 # deterministic salary growth for each entry age.

 # We start out with the case where 
    # (1) the starting salary at each entry age increases at the rate of productivity growth plus inflation.
    # (2) The starting salary at each entry age are obtained by scaling up the the salary at entry age 20,
    #     hence at any given period, the age-30 entrants at age 30 have the same salary as the age-20 entrants at age 30. 
 # The first step is to produce tables for a given year's starting salary.
